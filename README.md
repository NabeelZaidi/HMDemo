# HMDemo

This repository is created for coding test. 
There are three main steps -:
1. Data collection -> Load the data from https://books.toscrape.com/index.html site into Azure SQL using scraper.py file
2. Serving the data -> Get relevant information from the Azure SQL Database using the Flask app.
3. Securing your API -> Using APIM management with the help of subscription key.

Note-: API's can be secured by integrating the Azure WebApp, Azure SQL Database with the Vnet as well. But since that feature is costly, so not using it
